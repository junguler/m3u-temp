Octennial Tenure of the Kingship- Spartan kings liable to be deposed on the appearance of a meteor at the end of eight years- Superstitions as to meteors and stars- Octennial period of king's reign connected with the octennial cycle of the early Greek calendars- which in turn is an attempt to reconcile solar and lunar time- The octennial cycle in relation to the Greek doctrine of rebirth- Octennial tenure of the kingdom at Cnossus in Crete- Sacred marriage of the King and Queen of Cnossus (Minos and Pasiphae) as representatives of the Sun and Moon- Octennial tribute of youths and maidens to the Sun- represented by the Minotaur- at Cnossus- Octennial festivals of the Crowning at Delphi and of the Laurel-bearing at Thebes- both being dramatic representations of the slaying of a waterdragon- Theory that the dragons of Delphi and Thebes were kings who personated dragons or serpents- Greek belief in the transformation of gods and men into animals- Transformation of Cadmus and Harmonia into serpents- Transmigration of the souls of the dead into serpents and other wild animals- African kings claim kinship with powerful animals- The serpent the royal animal at Athens and Salamis-The wedding of Cadmus and Harmonia at Thebes perhaps a dramatic marriage of the Sun and Moon at the end of an eight years' cycle- This theory confirmed by the astronomical symbols carried by the Laurel-bearer at the octennial festival of Laurel-bearing- The Olympic festival based on the octennial cycle- The Olympic victors- male and female- perhaps personated the Sun and Moon and reigned as divine King and Queen for eight years. - Read by Leon Harvey - Duration 01:01:55

Tradition of the funeral origin of the great Greek games- In historical times games instituted in honour of many famous men in Greece- Funeral games celebrated by other peoples ancient and modern- The great Irish fairs- in which horseraces were conspicuous- said to have been founded in honour of the dead- Their relation to the harvest- Theory of the funeral origin of the Olympic games insufficient to explain all the features of the legends- Suggested theory of the origin of the Olympic games- The Olympic festival based on astronomical- not agricultural- considerations. PART 6. THE SLAUGHTER OF THE DRAGON. Widespread myth of the slaughter of a great dragon- Babylonian myth of Marduk and Tiamat- Indian myth of Indra and Vrtra- Two interpretations of the myth- one cosmological- the other totemic- Suggested reconciliation of the two interpretations.

Story of Lancelot and the proffered kingdom in the High History of the Holy Graal- Story of King Vikramaditya of Ujjain in India- Vikramaditya the son of an ass by a human mother- Stories of this type (Beauty and the Beast) probably based on totemism- Story of the parentage of Vikkramaditya points to a line of rajahs who had the ass for their crest- Similarly the maharajahs of Nagpur trace their descent from a cobra father and have the cobra for their crest. - Read by Leon Harvey - Duration 00:29:56

Traces in legend of a custom of compelling men to accept the fatal sovereignty- False conceptions of the primitive kingship- The modern European fear of death not shared in an equal degree by other races- Men of other races willing to sacrifice their lives for motives which seem to the modern European wholly inadequate- Indifference to death displayed in antiquity by the Thracians- Gauls- and Romans- and in modern times by the Chinese- Error of judging all men's fear of death by our own- Probability that in many races it would be easy to find men who would accept a kingdom on condition of being killed at the end of a short reign. - Read by Leon Harvey - Duration 00:28:22

Temporary kings sometimes related by blood to the royal family- Aun- King of Sweden- and the sacrifice of his nine sons- Tradition of King Athamas and his children- Family of royal descent liable to be sacrificed at Orchomenus- Thessalian and Boeotian kings seem to have sacrificed their sons instead of themselves- Sacrifice of king's sons among the Semites- Sacrifice of children to Baal among the Semites- Canaanite and Hebrew custom of burning firstborn children in honour of Baal or Moloch- Tradition of the origin of the Passover- Custom of sacrificing all the firstborn- whether animals or men- probably a very ancient Semitic institution- Sacrifice of firstborn children among many peoples- The Sacred Spring in ancient Italy- Different motives may have led to the killing of the firstborn- The doctrine of rebirth may have furnished one motive for the infanticide of the firstborn- The same belief may explain the rule of infant succession in Polynesia and may partly account for the prevalence of infanticide in that region- Abdication or deposition of the father when his son attains to manhood- Traces of such customs in Greek myth and legend- On the whole the sacrifice of a king's son as a substitute for his father would not be surprising- at least in Semitic lands. - Read by Leon Harvey - Duration 01:08:59

The Whitsuntide Mummers. The single combat of the King of the Wood at Nemi probably a mitigation of an older custom of putting him to death at the end of a fixed period- The theory confirmed by traces of a custom of periodically putting the representative of the treespirit to death in Northern Europe- Bavarian and Swabian customs of beheading the representatives of the tree-spirit at Whitsuntide- Killing the Wild Man in Saxony and Bohemia- Beheading the King on Whitmonday in Bohemia- The leaf-clad mummers in these customs represent the tree-spirit- The tree-spirit killed in order to prevent its decay and to ensure its revival in a vigorous successor- Resemblances between the North European customs and the rites of Nemi. PART 2. Mock Human Sacrifices. The mock killing of the leaf-clad mummers probably a substitute for an old custom of killing them in earnest- Substitution of mock human sacrifices for real ones in Minahassa- Arizona- Nias- and elsewhere- Mock human sacrifices carried out in efiigy in ancient Egypt- India- Siam- Japan- and elsewhere- Mimic sacrifices of fingers- Mimic rite of circumcision.

Bringing in Summer- Custom of Carrying out Death followed by a ceremony of bringing in Summer- represented by a tree or branches- New potency of life ascribed to the effigy of Death- The Summer-tree equivalent to the May-tree- The Summer-tree a revival of the image of Death- hence the image of Death must be an embodiment of the spirit of vegetation- The names of Carnival- Death- and Summer in these customs seem to cover an ancient spirit of vegetation- PART 7. Battle of Summer and Winter- Dramatic contests between representatives of Summer and Winter in Sweden- Germany- and Austria- The Queen of Winter and the Queen of May in the Isle of Man- Contests between representatives of Summer and Winter among the Esquimaux- Winter driven away by the Canadian Indians- The burning of Winter at Zurich- PART 8.

Death and Revival of Vegetation- The Russian Kostrubonko- Yarilo- and so on probably in origin spirits of the dying and reviving vegetation- Grief and gladness- love and hatred curiously blended in these ceremonies- Expulsion of Death sometimes enacted without an effigy- PART 10. Analogous Rites in India- Images of Siva and Parvati married- drowned- and mourned for in India- Equivalence of the custom to the spring ceremonies of Europe- PART II. The Magic Spring- The foregoing customs were originally rites intended to ensure the revival of nature in spring by means of imitative magic- In modern Europe these old magical rites have degenerated into mere pageants and pastimes- Parallel to the spring customs of Europe in the magical rites of the aborigines of Central Australia. - Read by Leon Harvey - Duration 01:04:16
